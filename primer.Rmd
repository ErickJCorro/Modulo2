## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here is a link to [GOOGLE](http://google.com)

Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__.

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_.
When we compile our document we are using the `rmarkdown` package

Here are some example R comands

```
2+2
mean(c(2,3,4,5,6,7))
```
Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breackfast
    - food
        + eggs
        + toast
        + bacons
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - brocoli
    - rice

>This is a blcok quote. This
>paragraph has two lines
>
>1. This is a list inside a block quote
>2. second item

Here is an example of nested blockquote

>This is a block quote. This 
>paragraph has two lines.
>
>> This text is nested

Here is an example of code in a blockcode

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
